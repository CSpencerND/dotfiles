/**
 * A simple interface for a timer which will call the given callback-function in
 *  intervals specified by the "delay"-setting.
 * <b>Documentation</b>
 * The JS standard functions "setTimeout()" and "setInterval()" don't seem to work, so
 *  we need to use the Mainloop-module. Documentation is hard to come by, here are some
 *  hints:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         Starting a new Timer/Interval:
 *         http://developer.gnome.org/glib/2.30/glib-The-Main-Event-Loop.html#g-timeout-add-seconds
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         Cancelling a Timer/Interval:
 *         http://developer.gnome.org/glib/2.30/glib-The-Main-Event-Loop.html#g-source-remove
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         Test-case from the Gjs Source, shows some of the syntax.
 *         http://git.gnome.org/browse/gjs/tree/test/js/testMainloop.js
 *     </li>
