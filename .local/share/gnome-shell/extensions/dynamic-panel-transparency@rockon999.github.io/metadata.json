  "description": "Miss dynamic panel transparency in 3.32 and up? Try the original dynamic panel with much more customization! This extension will fade your top panel to nothingness when there are no maximized windows present! Never again will the panel be abruptly darkened.\n\nMay be incompatible with some extensions that make extensive changes to the panel.\n\nIf your theme isn't working correctly with this extension enable 'Remove Excessive Panel Styling' in the Background section of preferences. This particularly impacts the default *Ubuntu* theme!",
