#: Terminal bell {{{

enable_audio_bell no

update_check_interval 0

#: silence.

# visual_bell_duration 0.0

#: Visual bell duration. Flash the screen when a bell occurs for the
#: specified number of seconds. Set to zero to disable.

# window_alert_on_bell yes

#: Request window attention on bell. Makes the dock icon bounce on
#: macOS or the taskbar flash on linux.

# bell_on_tab yes

#: Show a bell symbol on the tab if a bell occurs in one of the
#: windows in the tab and the window is not the currently focused
#: window

# command_on_bell none

#: Program to run when a bell occurs. The environment variable
#: KITTY_CHILD_CMDLINE can be used to get the program running in the
#: window in which the bell occurred.

#: Color scheme {{{

# foreground #dddddd
# background #000000

#: The foreground and background colors

# background_opacity 1.0

#: The opacity of the background. A number between 0 and 1, where 1 is
#: opaque and 0 is fully transparent.  This will only work if
#: supported by the OS (for instance, when using a compositor under
#: X11). Note that it only sets the background color's opacity in
#: cells that have the same background color as the default terminal
#: background. This is so that things like the status bar in vim,
#: powerline prompts, etc. still look good.  But it means that if you
#: use a color theme with a background color in your editor, it will
#: not be rendered as transparent.  Instead you should change the
#: default background color in your kitty config and not use a
#: background color in the editor color scheme. Or use the escape
#: codes to set the terminals default colors in a shell script to
#: launch your editor.  Be aware that using a value less than 1.0 is a
#: (possibly significant) performance hit.  If you want to dynamically
#: change transparency of windows set dynamic_background_opacity to
#: yes (this is off by default as it has a performance cost). Changing
#: this setting when reloading the config will only work if
#: dynamic_background_opacity was enabled in the original config.

# background_image none

#: Path to a background image. Must be in PNG format.

# background_image_layout tiled

#: Whether to tile or scale the background image.

# background_image_linear no

#: When background image is scaled, whether linear interpolation
#: should be used.

# dynamic_background_opacity no

#: Allow changing of the background_opacity dynamically, using either
#: keyboard shortcuts (increase_background_opacity and
#: decrease_background_opacity) or the remote control facility.
#: Changing this setting by reloading the config is not supported.

# background_tint 0.0

#: How much to tint the background image by the background color. The
#: tint is applied only under the text area, not margin/borders. Makes
#: it easier to read the text. Tinting is done using the current
#: background color for each window. This setting applies only if
#: background_opacity is set and transparent windows are supported or
#: background_image is set.

# dim_opacity 0.75

#: How much to dim text that has the DIM/FAINT attribute set. One
#: means no dimming and zero means fully dimmed (i.e. invisible).

# selection_foreground #000000

#: The foreground for text selected with the mouse. A value of none
#: means to leave the color unchanged.

# selection_background #fffacd

#: The background for text selected with the mouse.

#: The color table {{{

#: The 256 terminal colors. There are 8 basic colors, each color has a
#: dull and bright version, for the first 16 colors. You can set the
#: remaining 240 colors as color16 to color255.

#: example, the following opens the scrollback buffer in less in an
#: overlay window::

#:     map f1 launch --stdin-source=@screen_scrollback --stdin-add-formatting --type=overlay less +G -R

#: For more details on piping screen and buffer contents to external
#: programs, see launch.

#: Window management {{{

map ctrl+super+enter new_os_window_with_cwd
# map kitty_mod+enter new_window

confirm_os_window_close 0

#: You can open a new window running an arbitrary program, for
#: example::

#:     map kitty_mod+y      launch mutt

#: You can open a new window with the current working directory set to
#: the working directory of the current window using::

#:     map ctrl+alt+enter    launch --cwd=current

#: You can open a new window that is allowed to control kitty via the
#: kitty remote control facility by prefixing the command line with @.
#: Any programs running in that window will be allowed to control
#: kitty. For example::

#:     map ctrl+enter launch --allow-remote-control some_program

#: You can open a new window next to the currently active window or as
#: the first window, with::

#:     map ctrl+n launch --location=neighbor some_program
#:     map ctrl+f launch --location=first some_program

#: For more details, see launch.

# map kitty_mod+n new_os_window

#: Works like new_window above, except that it opens a top level OS
#: kitty window. In particular you can use new_os_window_with_cwd to
#: open a window with the current working directory.

# map kitty_mod+w close_window
# map kitty_mod+] next_window
# map kitty_mod+[ previous_window
# map kitty_mod+f move_window_forward

# map kitty_mod+.     move_tab_forward
# map kitty_mod+,     move_tab_backward
# map kitty_mod+alt+t set_tab_title

#: You can also create shortcuts to go to specific tabs, with 1 being
#: the first tab, 2 the second tab and -1 being the previously active
#: tab, and any number larger than the last tab being the last tab::

#:     map ctrl+alt+1 goto_tab 1
#:     map ctrl+alt+2 goto_tab 2

#: Just as with new_window above, you can also pass the name of
#: arbitrary commands to run when using new_tab and use
#: new_tab_with_cwd. Finally, if you want the new tab to open next to
#: the current tab rather than at the end of the tabs list, use::

#:     map ctrl+t new_tab !neighbor [optional cmd to run]
#: }}}

#: Layout management {{{

# map kitty_mod+l next_layout

#: You can also create shortcuts to switch to specific layouts::

#:     map ctrl+alt+t goto_layout tall
#:     map ctrl+alt+s goto_layout stack

#: Similarly, to switch back to the previous layout::

#:    map ctrl+alt+p last_used_layout

#: There is also a toggle layout function that switches to the named
#: layout or back to the previous layout if in the named layout.
#: Useful to temporarily "zoom" the active window by switching to the
#: stack layout::

#:     map ctrl+alt+z toggle_layout stack

#: Select and act on visible text {{{

#: Use the hints kitten to select text and either pass it to an
#: external program or insert it into the terminal or copy it to the
#: clipboard.

# map kitty_mod+e open_url_with_hints

#: Open a currently visible URL using the keyboard. The program used
#: to open the URL is specified in open_url_with.

# map kitty_mod+p>f kitten hints --type path --program -

#: Select a path/filename and insert it into the terminal. Useful, for
#: instance to run git commands on a filename output from a previous
#: git command.

# map kitty_mod+p>shift+f kitten hints --type path

#: Select a path/filename and open it with the default open program.

# map kitty_mod+p>l kitten hints --type line --program -

#: Select a line of text and insert it into the terminal. Use for the
#: output of things like: ls -1

# map kitty_mod+p>w kitten hints --type word --program -

#: Select words and insert into terminal.

# map kitty_mod+p>h kitten hints --type hash --program -

#: Select something that looks like a hash and insert it into the
#: terminal. Useful with git, which uses sha1 hashes to identify
#: commits

# map kitty_mod+p>n kitten hints --type linenum

#: Select something that looks like filename:linenum and open it in
#: vim at the specified line number.

# map kitty_mod+p>y kitten hints --type hyperlink

#: Select a hyperlink (i.e. a URL that has been marked as such by the
#: terminal program, for example, by ls --hyperlink=auto).


#: The hints kitten has many more modes of operation that you can map
#: to different shortcuts. For a full description see kittens/hints.

# map kitty_mod+u      kitten unicode_input
# map kitty_mod+f2     edit_config_file
# map kitty_mod+escape kitty_shell window

# map kitty_mod+a>l    set_background_opacity -0.1
# map kitty_mod+a>1    set_background_opacity 1
# map kitty_mod+a>d    set_background_opacity default
# map kitty_mod+delete clear_terminal reset active

#: You can create shortcuts to clear/reset the terminal. For example::

#:     # Reset the terminal
#:     map kitty_mod+f9 clear_terminal reset active
#:     # Clear the terminal screen by erasing all contents
#:     map kitty_mod+f10 clear_terminal clear active
#:     # Clear the terminal scrollback by erasing it
#:     map kitty_mod+f11 clear_terminal scrollback active
#:     # Scroll the contents of the screen into the scrollback
#:     map kitty_mod+f12 clear_terminal scroll active

#: If you want to operate on all windows instead of just the current
#: one, use all instead of active.

#: It is also possible to remap Ctrl+L to both scroll the current
#: screen contents into the scrollback buffer and clear the screen,
#: instead of just clearing the screen, for example, for ZSH add the
#: following to ~/.zshrc:

#: .. code-block:: sh

#:     scroll-and-clear-screen() {
#:         printf '\n%.0s' {1..$LINES}
#:         zle clear-screen
#:     }
#:     zle -N scroll-and-clear-screen
#:     bindkey '^l' scroll-and-clear-screen

# map kitty_mod+f5 load_config_file

#: Reload kitty.conf, applying any changes since the last time it was
#: loaded. Note that a handful of settings cannot be dynamically
#: changed and require a full restart of kitty.  You can also map a
#: keybinding to load a different config file, for example::

#:     map f5 load_config /path/to/alternative/kitty.conf

#: Note that all setting from the original kitty.conf are discarded,
#: in other words the new conf settings *replace* the old ones.

# map kitty_mod+f6 debug_config

#: Show details about exactly what configuration kitty is running with
#: and its host environment. Useful for debugging issues.


#: You can tell kitty to send arbitrary (UTF-8) encoded text to the
#: client program when pressing specified shortcut keys. For example::

#:     map ctrl+alt+a send_text all Special text

#: This will send "Special text" when you press the ctrl+alt+a key
#: combination.  The text to be sent is a python string literal so you
#: can use escapes like \x1b to send control codes or \u21fb to send
#: unicode characters (or you can just input the unicode characters
#: directly as UTF-8 text). The first argument to send_text is the
#: keyboard modes in which to activate the shortcut. The possible
#: values are normal or application or kitty or a comma separated
#: combination of them.  The special keyword all means all modes. The
#: modes normal and application refer to the DECCKM cursor key mode
#: for terminals, and kitty refers to the special kitty extended
#: keyboard protocol.

#: Another example, that outputs a word and then moves the cursor to
#: the start of the line (same as pressing the Home key)::

#:     map ctrl+alt+a send_text normal Word\x1b[H
#:     map ctrl+alt+a send_text application Word\x1bOH
