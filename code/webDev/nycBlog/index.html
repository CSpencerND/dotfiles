            New York City is made up of five boroughs which include Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Bronx,
            and Staten Island. The city is the home of approximately 8 million people. In 1876, France
            gifted the City of New York what is known as the Statue of Liberty, which is currently located
            on Ellis Island commonly visited by tourists. However, it took 10 years to assemble and
            therefore wasn't unveiled until 1886. Another tourist destination is Times Square, which is
            commonly known for the big buildings, Broadway shows, and bright neon signs. This famous
            location was named after The New York Times after they moved to that location. <br> Prior to that,
            it was named Longacre Square. New York City is also known for its bridges that connect the
            boroughs and allow ease of transportation.
