  		<h2>Home Sweet Home</h2>
  		<p>
  			I live in the woods in Pennsylvania, with my wife and two dogs. It's very quite here, and gorgeous, whether it's sunny or snowing.<br />
  			 I moved here just before the pandemic hit. What luck. Before this, I lived in NYC my entire life. I also gained a solid interest in coding since I've been here.

  		<h2>Food from around the world</h2>
  		<p>
  			I've been vegan for three years. It's extremely important that I learn to cook really delicious food of all kinds.<br />
  			 Of course, like everyone else these days, I made sourdough starter.

  		<h2>Music is my lifelong passion</h2>
  		<p>
  			I grew up on hip-hop. During my late teens to early 20s, I became enthralled by metal, and was drawn to the drums. The catalyst for my drumming is Danny Carey of Tool.
